    Choose how to resolve the e-mail of the authenticated user (you may want to install other plugins to get more options).<br />

   	If "any", Jenkins will choose the 1st working resolver.<br />

    Be aware that some options may not work if they come from plugins with their own configuration strategy.<br />
