  Each time the authentication is attempted (which is once per session),
  this script will be invoked with the username in the 'U' environment variable
  and the password in the 'P' environment variable. If the script returns exit code 0,
  the authentication is considered successful, and otherwise failed.

  In case of failure, the output from the process will be reported in the exception message.
